# Chordpro Docker Image
This is the basis for the [Docker-Image jayar79/chordpro](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jayar79/chordpro).

## latest

`latest`-tag just contains the prerequisites for using Chordpro - mainly intended for use with [VS Code and this repo-Image docker-build-image](https://github.com/JoeRu/chordpro_dev_env).

## master

`master` image contains the master-branch of [chordpro](https://github.com/ChordPro/chordpro).
This image should be used in a more productive environment

## dev

`dev` image should contain the latest development of chordpro. As is did not have a PRO Account in docker hub. This may tend to be outdated a bit.
